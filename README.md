# ontulily

`Ontulily` is a tool that can be used for website _stress testing_.

Website stress testing can be useful to find out whether your website is susceptible to [DoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) or [DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_attack) attacks.

## Useful information

* [Ontulily design guidelines](https://github.com/moshthepitt/ontulily/blob/master/docs/design.md)

## DDos & Dos Attacks

At this time, `ontulily` is designed to test for susceptibility to [Layer 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer) DoS and DDoS attacks.

Layer 7 attacks are some of the most difficult attacks to mitigate because they mimic normal user behavior and are harder to identify.  `ontulily` will help you test your website's vulnerability to these attacks.

## A word of warning

`Ontulily` is not meant to be used for malicious or illegal purposes.  It is your responsibility to ensure that you obey and adhere to all applicable laws.  The developers of `ontulily` assume no liability and are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this program.

## What does ontulily mean

I'm not sure.  When I was thinking about this project I asked one of my best friends - Coconut - about what to call it.  She suggested `ontulily`.  I think it might be the name of a place somewhere near [Nanyuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyuki).

## Credits

I was inspired by [Ufonet](https://github.com/epsylon/ufonet) to start working on ontulily.
